# Classification-of-Income-Parametric-and-Nonparametric-Models
This is the final project for Stat 527: Nonparametric Regression and Classification.

This project aims to apply our knowledge about parametric and non-parametric machine learning methods to a classification problem. We want to study the annual salaries of adults differ, in terms of whether they have reached 50K per year. The parametric methods include Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes classifier; and the non-parametric methods are Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). We will evaluate these methods based on four metrics, accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and Area Under Curve (AUC) for the ROC curve.
